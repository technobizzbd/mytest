These quotes remind us of the strength, resilience, and wisdom of women throughout history and inspire all of us here at Starship to continue fighting for a more just and equitable world.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p id=\"58eb\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph lr ls ev lt b lu lv lw lx ly lz ma mb mc md me mf mg mh mi mj mk ml mm mn mo eo bj\">Despite significant advances in recent years, women remain underrepresented in the technology and startup industries. According to a World Bank report, less than one-third of the global technology workforce is made up of women, and the number is even lower for women of color. Lack of diversity in the tech and startup industries is a complex problem with multiple causes.<\/p>\n<p id=\"881e\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph lr ls ev lt b lu lv lw lx ly lz ma mb mc md me mf mg mh mi mj mk ml mm mn mo eo bj\">One of the challenges women face in the tech and startup industries is the lack of female role models and mentors. Women often struggle to get support and guidance from other women in this field, which can make it difficult to navigate the industry and build a successful career.<\/p>\n<p id=\"3f0c\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph lr ls ev lt b lu lv lw lx ly lz ma mb mc md me mf mg mh mi mj mk ml mm mn mo eo bj\">Another challenge is gender bias. Research shows that women are often underrepresented and underrepresented in male-dominated fields such as technology. This bias can manifest itself in many ways, from unequal pay to exclusion from important decision-making processes.<\/p>\n<p id=\"a6d6\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph lr ls ev lt b lu lv lw lx ly lz ma mb mc md me mf mg mh mi mj mk ml mm mn mo eo bj\">However, many women are breaking through these barriers, fighting back and advocating for greater representation and inclusion within the industry, and making a name for themselves in the world of tech and startups.<\/p>\n<p id=\"6254\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph lr ls ev lt b lu lv lw lx ly lz ma mb mc md me mf mg mh mi mj mk ml mm mn mo eo bj\">Starship&#8217;s women from around the world are a perfect example of this. We have collected inspirational quotes from many of them, so let them be your role models and inspirations. Their words remind us that women are strong, resilient, and capable of achieving greatness. So let us take a moment to reflect on their wisdom and courage as we continue to strive for a more just and just world for all.<\/p>\n<p id=\"af52\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph lr ls ev lt b lu lv lw lx ly lz ma mb mc md me mf mg mh mi mj mk ml mm mn mo eo bj\">\u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026<\/p>\n<p id=\"343c\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph lr ls ev lt b lu lv lw lx ly lz ma mb mc md me mf mg mh mi mj mk ml mm mn mo eo bj\"><em class=\"mp\">&#8220;I&#8217;ve battled impostor syndrome since day one of my career. Dealing with imposter syndrome is sometimes not as easy as having a &#8216;lady boss mindset.&#8217; I&#8217;m seven years into my career and I always have to remind myself that if you walk into a room, you deserve to be in that room.  \u201d<\/em><\/p>\n<p id=\"f621\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph lr ls ev lt b lu lv lw lx ly lz ma mb mc md me mf mg mh mi mj mk ml mm mn mo eo bj\"><strong class=\"lt ew\"><em class=\"mp\">Andrea Martinez De Carolis, US-based Campus Marketing Manager<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p id=\"9f5d\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph lr ls ev lt b lu lv lw lx ly lz ma mb mc md me mf mg mh mi mj mk ml mm mn mo eo bj\"><em class=\"mp\">About recruitment:<\/em><\/p>\n<p id=\"897b\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph lr ls ev lt b lu lv lw lx ly lz ma mb mc md me mf mg mh mi mj mk ml mm mn mo eo bj\"><em class=\"mp\">\u201cSometimes in life you find yourself in a position where only one of the following applies: I like the people I work with, I like my job, I like my compensation. We all deserve to be admired, recognized, and challenged. Finding this balance will take time. But believe me, it&#8217;s there. Even if you find yourself searching for the right career trajectory, don&#8217;t compromise on yourself. Be clear about your goals, be upfront about your needs, and go after what you want. The job market is constantly changing, but right now, recruiters are waiting to find you. Now is the time. Don&#8217;t be afraid to leverage online resources, application platforms, and networks to accelerate your professional development.&#8221;<\/em><\/p>\n<p id=\"13f3\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph lr ls ev lt b lu lv lw lx ly lz ma mb mc md me mf mg mh mi mj mk ml mm mn mo eo bj\"><em class=\"mp\">About my goals:<\/em><\/p>\n<p id=\"b1fa\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph lr ls ev lt b lu lv lw lx ly lz ma mb mc md me mf mg mh mi mj mk ml mm mn mo eo bj\"><em class=\"mp\">\u201cMy ambition is to be known as someone who helps others.

What that really means is that you are assertive, ask the right questions, and lead with your head and heart. Don&#8217;t let others change or deflate you, stay true to yourself, and be open to change and growth. Make brave decisions with patience and de-prioritize people-pleasing.<\/em><\/p>\n<p id=\"ecea\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph lr ls ev lt b lu lv lw lx ly lz ma mb mc md me mf mg mh mi mj mk ml mm mn mo eo bj\"><strong class=\"lt ew\"><em class=\"mp\">Teele Kruzman, Head of Services and Deployment, Estonia<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p id=\"697f\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph lr ls ev lt b lu lv lw lx ly lz ma mb mc md me mf mg mh mi mj mk ml mm mn mo eo bj\"><em class=\"mp\">&#8220;Diversity of thought and experience leads to breakthrough ideas.
