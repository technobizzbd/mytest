No other autonomous delivery service has achieved this and we are extremely proud of our team for achieving this feat. This milestone distance is further than any other company in the industry and more than six times his 1 million miles recently announced by international self-driving car developers Waymo and Cruise.<\/p>\n<p id=\"7c02\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph lr ls ev lt b lu lv lw lx ly lz ma mb mc md me mf mg mh mi mj mk ml mm mn mo eo bj\">But what really sets us apart is the level of autonomy our robots have achieved. We have recently seen some data where one of our robots delivered food to a customer 100% autonomously over a period of 16 hours, without any human intervention or supervision, for 24 consecutive times. I was surprised that it was completed.<\/p>\n<p id=\"2052\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph lr ls ev lt b lu lv lw lx ly lz ma mb mc md me mf mg mh mi mj mk ml mm mn mo eo bj\">Today, our robots are part of many people&#8217;s daily lives. Building on our success in offering delivery from hundreds of stores through our unique Starship app, we are now offering our &#8216;As a Service&#8217; option to global partners who want to make their own deliveries more sustainable, lower cost and more enjoyable. We offer &#8220;Delivery as a Service&#8221; (DaaS). Currently, last mile delivery is very inefficient and expensive, so there is a lot of interest in using our technology. We have proven that our technology has the potential to revolutionize last-mile delivery, which is currently one of the most inefficient and expensive parts of the delivery process.<\/p>\n<p id=\"ce65\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph lr ls ev lt b lu lv lw lx ly lz ma mb mc md me mf mg mh mi mj mk ml mm mn mo eo bj\">This milestone is an amazing achievement and shows that our service is truly leading the way in the self-driving delivery industry. We recently shared that our robots have made over 4 million autonomous deliveries and averaged 140,000 road crossings per day. He has over 2,000 robots roaming around the world, so it&#8217;s only a matter of time before they cross 20 million kilometers.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p>[ad_2]<br \/>\n<br \/><a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/starshiptechnologies\/starship-technologies-sets-another-world-record-with-10-million-kilometers-driven-867590ce8f4c?source=rss----dfecf423e3d---4\">Source link <\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>[ad_1] It&#8217;s another exciting day here at Starship.
