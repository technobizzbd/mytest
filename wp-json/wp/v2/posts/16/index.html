As a first-generation student and child of immigrant parents, I decided to push myself further into the minority group by identifying as lesbian and marrying a deaf wife. When I first started coming out of the closet, it went through a lot for me. Please travel (even if it doesn&#8217;t work)! All kidding aside, my story seemed so far removed from other stories that I honestly felt scared and at times overwhelmed that I couldn&#8217;t empathize with three of my gay friends from high school. That was until I attended my first Seattle Pride Parade in 2012. The Seattle Pride Parade was a place where I met and connected with many Asian Americans who shared the same struggles as me (coming out to my parents, being shunned by my family). and kicked out of the house, and the list goes on). So that was my coming out story, caught between two parentheses. Sure, it might not make sense to most people, but it made sense to us. Thanks to Pride, I was able to find a home I never knew existed. Pride also gave me a voice. It&#8217;s important to me (and my wife) to use the voices we have, to express our true selves, and to support the generations of queers and baby gays who are still discovering their sexuality. To restore the rights and freedoms that were and are still denied to us. voice. Visibility is very important, which is why our participation in the Pride March is important.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p id=\"0952\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph lr ls fl lt b lu lv lw lx ly lz ma mb mc md me mf mg mh mi mj mk ml mm mn mo eo bj\">3.

Pride reminds us of the struggles and sacrifices of our predecessors who fought for LGBTQ+ rights and paved the way for greater acceptance and equality. But it&#8217;s also a call to action: we&#8217;re not done yet. It also represents a call to action, urging us all to continue working towards a future where everyone is treated with dignity, respect and equal rights, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity. .<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<figure class=\"os ot ou ov ow fb et eu paragraph-image\">\n<div role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\" class=\"fc fd fe ff bg fg\">\n<div class=\"et eu pd\"><picture><source srcset=\"https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/v2\/resize:fit:640\/format:webp\/1*lIOlZyyFfERgtSw4TN__wQ.jpeg 640w, https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/v2\/resize:fit:720\/format:webp\/1*lIOlZyyFfERgtSw4TN__wQ.jpeg 720w, https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/v2\/resize:fit:750\/format:webp\/1*lIOlZyyFfERgtSw4TN__wQ.jpeg 750w, https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/v2\/resize:fit:786\/format:webp\/1*lIOlZyyFfERgtSw4TN__wQ.jpeg 786w, https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/v2\/resize:fit:828\/format:webp\/1*lIOlZyyFfERgtSw4TN__wQ.jpeg 828w, https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/v2\/resize:fit:1100\/format:webp\/1*lIOlZyyFfERgtSw4TN__wQ.jpeg 1100w, https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/v2\/resize:fit:1400\/format:webp\/1*lIOlZyyFfERgtSw4TN__wQ.jpeg 1400w\" sizes=\"(min-resolution: 4dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 50vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 4) and (max-width: 700px) 50vw, (min-resolution: 3dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 67vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3) and (max-width: 700px) 65vw, (min-resolution: 2.5dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 80vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2.5) and (max-width: 700px) 80vw, (min-resolution: 2dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 100vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2) and (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" type=\"image\/webp\"\/><source data-testid=\"og\" srcset=\"https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/v2\/resize:fit:640\/1*lIOlZyyFfERgtSw4TN__wQ.jpeg 640w, https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/v2\/resize:fit:720\/1*lIOlZyyFfERgtSw4TN__wQ.jpeg 720w, https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/v2\/resize:fit:750\/1*lIOlZyyFfERgtSw4TN__wQ.jpeg 750w, https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/v2\/resize:fit:786\/1*lIOlZyyFfERgtSw4TN__wQ.jpeg 786w, https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/v2\/resize:fit:828\/1*lIOlZyyFfERgtSw4TN__wQ.jpeg 828w, https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/v2\/resize:fit:1100\/1*lIOlZyyFfERgtSw4TN__wQ.jpeg 1100w, https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/v2\/resize:fit:1400\/1*lIOlZyyFfERgtSw4TN__wQ.jpeg 1400w\" sizes=\"(min-resolution: 4dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 50vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 4) and (max-width: 700px) 50vw, (min-resolution: 3dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 67vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3) and (max-width: 700px) 65vw, (min-resolution: 2.5dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 80vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2.5) and (max-width: 700px) 80vw, (min-resolution: 2dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 100vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2) and (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\"\/><img alt=\"Reed holds a palm-sized Pride flag at New York's first Pride in 2022.\" class=\"bg fh fi c\" width=\"700\" height=\"934\" loading=\"lazy\"\/><\/picture><\/div>\n<\/div><figcaption class=\"ox oy oz et eu pa pb be b bf z hq\">Reed attended his first Pride at the 2022 New York City Pride Parade!<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p id=\"876c\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph lr ls fl lt b lu lv lw lx ly lz ma mb mc md me mf mg mh mi mj mk ml mm mn mo eo bj\">As we eagerly prepare to march at LA Pride, we are filled with joy, purpose, and a sense of unity.
