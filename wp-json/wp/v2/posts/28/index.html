Just like those who have had to overcome obstacles and keep moving forward, we too must learn from our experiences and use them to become better.<\/p>\n<p id=\"54ca\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph lc ld ev le b lf lg lh li lj lk ll lm ln lo lp lq lr ls lt lu lv lw lx ly lz eo bj\">Starship strives every day to live up to our core values. These are the values \u200b\u200bthat guide each of us, and they extend far beyond our work within our company, the people we work with, the people we reach, and the impact we seek to create. It extends to things. Each journey, whether personal or professional, is an opportunity to learn and improve.<\/p>\n<p id=\"2fb8\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph lc ld ev le b lf lg lh li lj lk ll lm ln lo lp lq lr ls lt lu lv lw lx ly lz eo bj\">First, let me state that diversity in technology is still a concern in 2023.  According to the Kapor Center&#8217;s 2022 State of Tech Diversity Report, &#8220;Between 2014 and 2021, the percentage of Black people in technical roles at large technology companies increased by only 1%.&#8221; Diversity Goals to reach a point where it is widely acknowledged that a fair, inclusive and inclusive workplace benefits everyone. This kind of work environment provides space for diverse perspectives, fosters creativity, develops problem-solving skills, and fosters innovation. As a company, we passionately advocate for diversifying our leadership team (representation is key) and expanding our DEI efforts. As the late activist and literary icon Maya Angelou said: And when we know better, we do better.  \u201d<\/p>\n<p id=\"b8f4\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph lc ld ev le b lf lg lh li lj lk ll lm ln lo lp lq lr ls lt lu lv lw lx ly lz eo bj\">At Starship, by working as a team and guided by data, we can accomplish more together than we could ever accomplish alone.  As we reflect on the countless barriers and obstacles that BIPOC people have overcome, we are inspired by this resilience and determination to overcome adversity while overcoming every curb, and that we, too, can overcome these challenges. I know. The dedication of our Black colleagues, friends, and family reminds us that with perseverance, we can always achieve our goals and aspirations.<\/p>\n<p id=\"a0d8\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph lc ld ev le b lf lg lh li lj lk ll lm ln lo lp lq lr ls lt lu lv lw lx ly lz eo bj\">In the spirit of progress and innovation, we would like to use this time to remember the purpose of Black History Month through consciously recognizing the historical leaders who have brought us to where we are today. I am. Later this month, Starship will share her highlights of Black contributors in the AI \u200b\u200band robotics field, highlighting the outstanding achievements of BIPOC pioneers. Without their outstanding contributions, AI and robotics would not be where it is today.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p>[ad_2]<br \/>\n<br \/><a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/starshiptechnologies\/in-honor-of-black-history-month-c7d02c3230d6?source=rss----dfecf423e3d---4\">Source link <\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>[ad_1] Author: Red Nardos Black History Month is a time to reflect on the contributions and accomplishments of Black individuals throughout history, but it is also a time to remember the struggles and challenges they have faced and continue to face.
